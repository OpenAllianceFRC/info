# The Open Alliance Guidelines
1) regular, current, updates 1 or more times per week. Include analysis and notes or thoughts on what went well and what did not.
2) use a format that is conducive to asking and answering questions
3) complete pics and vids in context.
4) public cad/code encouraged but not required
5) include the bad with the good. We want a complete picture, not a highlight reel.
6) in for a penny in for a pound. If you share a mechanism or idea or function you must publish all details required to successfully execute it.
