# The Open Alliance
## What is The Open Alliance?
The #openalliance members all believe that FRC can have a greater impact on all teams if our ideas are shared throughout the season. With the end of The Bag, there’s a chance that FRC teams may become more secretive than they are now, and we’re hoping to stop that trend before it has a chance to start. We think that teams can share information and still be competitive, and that a rising tide lifts all boats.

## Guidelines for participation
1) regular, current, updates 1 or more times per week. Include analysis and notes or thoughts on what went well and what did not.
2) use a format that is conducive to asking and answering questions
3) complete pics and vids in context.
4) public cad/code encouraged but not required
5) include the bad with the good. We want a complete picture, not a highlight reel.
6) in for a penny in for a pound. If you share a mechanism or idea or function you must publish all details required to successfully execute it.
