# The Open Alliance
## What is The Open Alliance?
The #openalliance members all believe that FRC can have a greater impact on all teams if our ideas are shared throughout the season. With the end of The Bag, there’s a chance that FRC teams may become more secretive than they are now, and we’re hoping to stop that trend before it has a chance to start. We think that teams can share information and still be competitive, and that a rising tide lifts all boats.

## Guidelines for participation
1) Don't keep secrets
   * Sharing and learning is our competitive advantage, not secrets.
   * Don't withold "that one detail" that makes an idea or mechanism work.  If you share it, share it all.
3) Try to update 1 or more times per week. 
   * Include analysis and notes or thoughts on what went well and what did not.
4) Use a platform that is conducive to asking and answering questions.
   * We recommend either (ChiefDelphi)[chiefdelphi.com] or (Discord)[https://discord.gg/pMxQD8SgJh]
5) Post lots of pictures and videos!
   * People love to look at pictures and videos
   * A picture really is worth 1000 words.
6) Open CAD and code are encouraged but not required.
7) Include the bad with the good. 
   * We want a complete picture, not a highlight reel.
   * Posting the bad helps everyone learn.
